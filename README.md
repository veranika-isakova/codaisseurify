# Ð¡odaisseurify

[Here you can see the deployed version](https://codaisseurify2017isakova.herokuapp.com/)

A Ruby on Rails program that allows user, after sign up and log in, to see the artist's information: the country, the official site, biography and all songs related to this artist. 

If, for some reason, the user wants to delete the artist from the list, he/she can do it clicking on the button.

You can delete a particular song or all songs together, add new song and save it to the specific artist.
